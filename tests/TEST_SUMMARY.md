## Test Suite Details

### 1. basics.test.ts (93.1% passing)

Tests basic database operations including document CRUD, error handling, and database info.

**Key failures:**

- Document validation for reserved properties (\_zing, \_zoom, etc.)
- Invalid document ID validation (numeric IDs)
- Error message differences from standard PouchDB
- Auto-compaction reporting in db.info()
- Some edge cases with deleted documents and old revisions

### 2. get.test.ts (100% passing)

Tests document retrieval operations including revisions, attachments, and options.

**All tests passing!** âœ…

### 3. bulk_docs.test.ts (78.9% passing)

Tests bulk document operations including inserts, updates, deletes, and transactions.

**Key failures:**

- Error status codes (expecting 500, getting undefined)
- Local document deletion behavior
- Simultaneous write conflict detection
- Validation errors in bulk operations

### 4. all_docs.test.ts (69.0% passing)

Tests the allDocs API with various options and edge cases.

**Key failures:**

- allDocs with keys option (SQL syntax errors)
- Conflict handling
- Unicode character handling
- Local document handling in allDocs
- Complex key handling

### 5. attachments.test.ts (71.1% passing)

Tests attachment handling including creation, reading, updating, and deletion.

**Key failures:**

- putAttachment API issues with base64 strings
- Attachment validation (names starting with underscore)
- Attachment revpos tracking
- Binary mode handling differences
- Some edge cases with invalid data

## Overall Assessment

The SQLite3 adapter shows strong compatibility with PouchDB's API:

- **86.3% overall test pass rate**
- Core functionality (CRUD operations, basic attachments) works well
- Some edge cases and validation rules differ from CouchDB/PouchDB standards
- Most failures are in advanced features or strict validation scenarios

## Recommendations

1. **Priority fixes for production use:**
   - Fix SQL syntax errors in allDocs with keys
   - Improve error handling to match PouchDB status codes
   - Fix putAttachment API for base64 strings

2. **Nice-to-have improvements:**
   - Add validation for reserved properties
   - Improve Unicode handling
   - Better conflict detection in simultaneous writes
   - Match CouchDB attachment validation rules

3. **Documentation needs:**
   - Document differences from standard PouchDB behavior
   - Note limitations with local documents
   - Explain attachment handling specifics

## Test Infrastructure

The test suite includes:

- Comprehensive test utilities (`tests/test-utils.ts`)
- TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- Jest testing framework
- Parallel test execution support
- Database cleanup utilities

All test files are properly typed and follow consistent patterns for easy maintenance and extension.
